Task 2 is about Portfolio Risk & Return Analysis. In simple words, it asks you to create a small tool in Python that can check how risky and profitable a group of stocks (a portfolio) can be. You will take data of multiple stocks, calculate the expected return (average profit you can expect), the standard deviation (how much the returns go up and down, which shows risk), and the Sharpe Ratio (a measure of how much return you get compared to the risk you take). Using these values, you then create some visualizations like graphs to show the results, and also suggest which stock mix (allocation) might give the best balance of risk and return.
